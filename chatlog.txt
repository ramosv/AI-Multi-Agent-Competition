[13:52:14] Admin: Your job is to analyze grids and discuss patterns that you find in them.

[13:52:17] Agent 1: The key pattern is that rectangular regions made of connected 1's get transformed into 3's, while isolated 1's and pairs of 1's remain unchanged as 1's.
[13:52:19] Agent 2: Connected 1's forming rectangles of size >2 transform to 3's, while single/paired 1's remain unchanged.
[13:52:21] Agent 3: Connected 1's in rectangles where |area| > 2 â†’ 3's, else 1's persist.
[13:52:25] Agent 4: Connected 1's forming areas >2 â†’ 3's, single/paired 1's stay.
[13:52:28] Agent 1: Areas of 1's > 2 â†’ 3's, else â†’ 1's.                         
[13:52:30] Agent 2: Connected 1's > 2 â†’ 3's, else 1's.                          
[13:52:33] Agent 3: 1's > 2 â†’ 3's, else 1's.                                    
[13:52:35] Agent 4: Connected(1's) > 2 = 3's, else 1's.                         
[13:52:37] Agent 1: |Group(1's)| > 2 â†’ 3's.                                     
[13:52:38] Agent 2: |1's_connected| > 2 â†’ 3.
